# UFOs
## Overview
This project was used to gain familiarity with basics of JavaScript. 
### Purpose
We helped Dana build a webpage with a dynamic table. This page contains numerous UFO sightings, where they occurred, what they looked like, and a brief explanation of the event. Anyone who visits it can filter by data, city, state, country, or the shap of the UFO, they table updates as soon as input is entered. 

## Resources
### Data Sources
- data.js
### Software
- VSCode 
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Results
This webpage is simple in its design and utility. It can be easily navigated by filling in the desired location, date, or shape. The date bar can be accessed the same as the other searches, the dates are confined between 01/01/2010 and 01/13/2010. Multiple criteria can also be entered, to filter down even further. 
- Figure 1: To find a desired city, enter that city into the "Enter City" search bar.

- Figure 2: To find a desired state, enter that state into the "Enter State" search bar.

- Figure 3: To find a desired country, enter that country into the "Enter Country" search bar. (The results only include incidences in the United States, so searching for Den (Denmark) won't return any results)

## Summary
This webpage is simple and direct, one flaw in particular is the lack of multiple pages. One must scroll through all of it all at once with no page breaks. If more data is ever entered into the database then a page break will be necessary so it isn't all in one space. Two ways that this page could be improved, is the creation of an enter button, the vast majority of searches occur with the pressing of an "Enter" button, and the addition of this is likely to make the page even more intuitive. A second reccomendation is to make the search results more fluid; If someone enters Florida instead of fl, it won't return a result, same if someone searches Loveland instead of loveland, they won't get output even though there are sightings for both of those locations. The final recommendation is the addition of data, there is a span of 12 days, there is a search bar for Country, but the only sightings are in the US making the buttons redundant.
